      <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>
      <p>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
      <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.</p>

              <p>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</p> 
<h3>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h3>
<p>
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>

                        <section class="main-section" id="Execution"><header>Execution</header>
                        <p>Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
   <code>
     <p>>>> print("Hello, World!")</p>
<p>Hello, World!</p>
     </code>       
     <p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:</p>            
        <code>
<p>C:\Users\YourName>python myfile.py</p>
     </code>  </section>
                              <section class="main-section" id="Syntax"><header>Syntax</header>
      <h3>Python Indentation</h3>
      <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.</p>
<code>
  <p>if 5 > 2:
</p>
  <p> &nbsp &nbsp print("Five is greater than two!")</p>
</code>
      <h3>Python Variables</h3>
      <p>In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it.Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
      <code>
        <p>x = 5</p>
        <p>y = "Hello, World!"</p>
      </code>

      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment.</p>        
<code>
  <p>#This is a comment.</p>
  <p>print("Hello, World!")</p>
  </code>
